# Executive Summary
The following report presents a comprehensive analysis of the user funnel for Metro Car services, over a one-year period.
The objective is to identify drop-offs and provide stage-specific recommendations to enhance conversion rates and
ultimately optimize revenue. Key metrics and trends have been examined to derive actionable insights for optimization.

 Recommendations for Downloads Stage:
 
 <li>Ensure the app's listing emphasizes key
features and benefits.</li>
<li>Implement targeted ad campaigns to attract
potential users.</li>
<li>Evaluate and address any discrepancies in
tracking to ensure accurate conversion
rates.</li>

Total Sign-ups: 17,623
Conversion Rate: 74.6%
Drop-off from Downloads to sign ups:
25.4%
## Recommendations for Sign-up Stage:
- Optimize the sign-up process for
simplicity and clarity.
- Design an alternate interface and
Conduct A/B testing on the sign-up
process to enhance user experience
and reduce drop-offs.

# FOCAL POINT
![focalpoint](https://github.com/indexsam/metro_funnelAnalysis/blob/master/focal.PNG)

## Observations
High request rates observed from
8am
-10am and 4pm
-8pm (peak periods)
- Lower request rates outside these
time slots, with a slight improvement
between 10am and 3pm.
- The number of accepts by drivers at
peak periods are significantly lower
with respect to the number of
requests.
- The numbers of cancelations are
approximately equal to the numbers
of completed rides/transactions.
- To optimize revenue, we want to
increase the number of accepts and
reduce the number of cancelations.

# Time analysis
![time](https://github.com/indexsam/metro_funnelAnalysis/blob/master/time.PNG)

As indicated above within the red cloud, between 10am and 3pm, Revenue bumps up towards the number of accepts as
the number of cancelations reduces. It is important to note that number of completed rides amount to the number of
transactions. Suffice to say therefore that clients pay for their rides.

# User Observations
![user](https://github.com/indexsam/metro_funnelAnalysis/blob/master/user_observe.PNG)

Relatively more users on the IOS platform than the
android and web put together.
In addition, we cannot assume an age range for the
unknown users group as they could be a mixture across all
age demography.

# Recommendations
Improving the number of driver accepts and reducing cancellations during peak periods would significantly increase
revenue. Combinations of strategic measures to incentivize both drivers and users, enhance communication, and
optimize the overall user experience are some recommended below:
Improving Driver Acceptance Rates:
1. Surge Pricing Adjustments:
Dynamically adjust surge pricing to incentivize drivers to be available during peak periods. Ensure that pricing reflects the
increased demand while remaining attractive to drivers.
2. Incentive Programs:
Implement targeted incentive programs for drivers during peak hours, offering bonuses, higher per-ride commissions, or
rewards for completing a certain number of rides during busy periods.
3. Real-Time Driver Information:
Provide drivers with real-time information about high-demand areas and expected wait times. This enables them to make
informed decisions about where to position themselves for better ride opportunities.
4. Pre-Booking Notifications:
Allow users to pre-book rides during peak hours, giving drivers the opportunity to plan their schedules and reducing the
uncertainty associated with peak demand periods.
5. Driver Bonuses for Long Trips:
Introduce bonuses or incentives for drivers who accept and complete longer rides during peak periods, encouraging them
to stay available for more extended trips.
6. Communication Channels:
Improve communication channels between the platform and drivers during peak hours, providing timely updates on
demand patterns, traffic conditions, and potential high-earning opportunities.

## Reducing Client Cancellations:
1. Transparent Estimated Wait Times:
 Provide users with accurate estimated wait times during peak periods. Transparency can help manage user expectations
and reduce cancellations due to perceived delays.
2. In-App Notifications:
Implement in-app notifications to inform users about the high demand and potential delays during peak hours. Encourage
users to plan ahead or consider alternative transportation options if needed.
3. Incentives for Wait Times:
Introduce incentives for users who are willing to wait a bit longer for a ride during peak periods. This could be in the form
of discounts or loyalty rewards
4. Preferred Pickup Locations:
Allow users to set preferred pickup locations within a reasonable distance. This can reduce cancellations caused by
difficulty in finding the exact pick-up point during busy periods.
5. Cancellation Fees and Policies:
Clearly communicate cancellation fees to users. Consider adjusting the cancellation policy during peak hours to
discourage unnecessary cancellations.
6. User Education:
Educate users on the impact of cancellations on the overall efficiency of the service and encourage responsible usage
during peak periods.

# Conclusion
This report aims to ramp up revenue via a funnel analysis on the KPIs that drives the metro car enterprise. Implementing a
combination of these recommended strategies, tailored to the specific dynamics of the service, can help strike a balance
between supply and demand, improve driver and user satisfaction, and create a more reliable and efficient ride-hailing
experience during peak periods. It is important to note that regular assessing of the effectiveness of these measures
through data analysis and user feedback as an iterative procedure is inevitable.
